# Interacting with the websocket

## Establish a connection

```ts
const ws = new Websocket(url);
```

## Send a message

```ts
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'routeName', param1: 'x', param2: 'y' }));
```

### Example: Student submit route

```ts
ws.send(
	JSON.stringify({ action: 'submit', optionId: 'option', ucfid: 'ucfid' })
);
```

## Recieving messages

```ts
ws.onmessage = (event: MessageEvent) => {
	const message = JSON.parse(event.data);

	switch (message.action) {
		case 'startQuestion':
			setQuestion(message.payload.question);
			break;
		case 'endQuestion':
			setQuestion(null);
			break;
		case 'endSession':
			// go back to home screen
			break;
	}
};
```

## Close Connection

```ts
ws.close();
```
